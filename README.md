# Aanchal Karamchandani 

I work at the intersection of **LLM engineering**, **applied NLP**, and **real-world AI systems**.  
My experience includes building production-grade Llama-based models, high-throughput NLP pipelines, and end-to-end ML applications in healthcare, cloud, and automation domains.

I enjoy designing systems where model reasoning, tools, and workflows come together in a clean and dependable way. Much of my focus is on understanding agent behavior, structuring decision flows, and translating complex ideas into clear, reproducible notebooks.

## What I Work On  

- AI agents with LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and SmolAgents  
- Practical LLM apps: prompting, evaluation, deployment  
- RAG pipelines and document intelligence  
- Large-scale NLP pipelines and model optimization  
- Writing clear, accessible ML + LLM content

## What I Write About

I publish **beginner-friendly, story-driven articles** on Medium focusing on:  
- LLM fundamentals and intuition-building  
- Tokenization, embeddings, and transformer internals  
- Hands-on ML concepts explained visually  
- Agent workflows and practical use-cases  

My goal is to make complex ideas feel simple, relatable, and actually enjoyable to learn.
